Basic Thirteen Algorithms 

## Basic Thirteen Algos
These Algorithms just go over the basic understanding of:
    - for loops
    - functions
    - return and print statements
    - declearing variables

### Print 1 to 255
Using a basic For Loop to print out integers from 1 to 255


### Print Ints and Sums
Using a basic For Loop to print out integers from 0 to 255 while printing the sum of each integer so far

### Print the Max of an Array
Using a Function, For Loop and creating a variable to print out the max value of an array
    - Provided test cases to include negatives to ensure proper results
